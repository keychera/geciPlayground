# Geci (Not anymore) Playground, a Code Generation Playground

initially a playground where I learn java::geci to solve a problem of mine generating java sources. Halfway
 experimenting, I found out about forge/roaster and decided to switch to that instead.
 
Now, this has become a playground where I tinker about anything code generation related. 

Currently, learning how to use Java Annotation Processor.
 
the key maven lifecycle: `mvn generate-sources`
